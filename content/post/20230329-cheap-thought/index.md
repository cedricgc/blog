Our industry, the realm of bits, is organized around the idea that developing software is an expensive endeavor. Not only are software engineers expensive, code itself has a certain _weight_ to it. Once code is written, it must be maintained and extended. Bugs and migrations are expensive mistakes that push us to shift development leftward with practices like continuous integration (CI), test driven development (TDD), and code reviews which aim to identify issues as early as possible.

What happens if artificial intelligence, through independent agents or hyper-augmented humans, makes writing code (effectively, _thinking_) too cheap to meter? I think the realization will set in that the vast majority of code is commoditized scaffolding. The true bottleneck is our understanding, the limit of complexity we can grasp and convey between human and machine. Under the iceberg, a massive structure of shifting code and compute will support us.

This isn't so different from what we do today. Software is a field where developers stand on giants atop of titans, from foundational theory in managing data to practical open source libraries that get the nitty-gritty work done. In larger companies, the developers working on the connective tissue we call infrastructure can match or dwarf the application developers that build for the actual end user. The notable adjustment will be how we operate in this scaffold, where any part of the codebase that even whiffs of reusable glue will be generated on demand from work done before. The speed of change will also be breathtaking in a world where you can generate five possible modifications, test out each change in a independent environment, and deploy immediately for your users.

Like a fractal, we will quickly learn to focus on the big idea at each level of the stack. What is needed to drive the core thesis of the company? What is the most significant improvement that I can make to our app? What is the most important thing I need to build today?
